## About me
Hello, my name is **Maksim Daunarovich**. I am a Front-End Developer with, what I believe, quite rare skill - I posses
extensive working knowledge and experience in the field of User Interface and User Experience design.

### Skills
- Range of bitmap and vector editors - `Photoshop`, `Illustrator`, `Figma` are my main weapons in that field
- My development toolbelt is revolving around `React` and libraries from React ecosystem: 
    - `Redux`, `MST` and `Mobx` for state management
    - `Styled Components`
    - `Styled System`
    - `Storybook`
- Different charting libraries - most of them based on **D3** - `Highcharts`, `React-Stockcharts`, `Chart.js` 
just to name a few
- `web3.js` and `ethers.js` - while these are not the libraries I'm using on day-to-day basis, I have a working experience
of building web applications using them 

### Open Source Contribution
I had and chance to participate in several open source projects. Most noticeable are:
- [LeapDAO](https://github.com/leapdao) was building a Layer-2 scaling solution via plasma blockchain. I have participated 
in several repositories, contributing to smart contracts, front-end, documentation, tutorials and core development.
- [DEORA](https://github.com/deora-earth/voting-frontend) was building quadrating solution for VOLT party, building on 
top of Burner Wallet. My contribution included work on smart contracts and front-end design and development.
- [Planet A](https://github.com/social-dist0rtion-protocol/planet-a) is a social game built on top of Leap Network and
Burner Wallet.
- [Burner Wallet](https://github.com/burner-wallet) - several of the previously mentioned project, where utilizing the
Power of Burner Wallet and some of the solutions I've came up with, were pushed upstream.

### Fun Projects
From time to time I stumble into a new piece of technology or some fancy idea and I try to explore it and see what I can
build with it. Here's a list of the most recent:
- [Flow Playground Enhancer](https://github.com/MaxStalker/flow-playground-enhancer) - During my time fiddling with [Flow
Playground](https://play.onflow.org/) someone mentioned that editor is currently missing `dark mode`, so I thought to myself
how hard it would be to simply edit CSS in the dev tools and apply them every time one open a sandbox. Then to make it 
easier for end users I decided to build Chrome extension (the article I've read week prior suddenly came handy ðŸ˜Ž). Long
story short - I've made one and then some more quality-of-life changes on top, which I and several other members of
Flow community were missing.
- **Figma Plugins** - In June 2019, **Figma** introduced API, which could have been used to create plugins to Figma
editor. The devs were really helpful and community responsive. I had a chance to build plugins, that I used to prepare
flyers for Berlin Blockchain Week. Build some fancy projects, like avatar generator and component factory, and help other
members, when they were stuck with some common problems. One of the best times in 2019 ðŸ¤—
