            <p>At Saturno I was a leading Front-End Design and Development of company products, which were ranging from
                SEO dashboard to LiveDealer client. Main product was implemented with heavy use of jQuery and vanilla
                javascript and at the later stage it was partially rewritten with use of React. Other projects were
                implemented in React with use of libraries like Reflux, Redux, RxJs, Socket.io, D3 and others.
            <p>
            <p>
                On Design part of the job I was responsible for every aspect of visual appearance of products the
                company was making: user interfaces, visual effects, motion mockups, presentations, logos, etc.
